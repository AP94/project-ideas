# No computer project



Blueprints for a building. Pretty straightforward.



## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a

good way to meet their needs.



This would serve architectual engineers, construction workers, and other people who would need to know exactly what to do to to create the building.



### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's

experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 

them?_



Everyone listed above. Without blueprints, it may be possible to create buildings, but not skyscrapers. Anything that takes into account the laws of physics would probably need detailed planning.



### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_



It lets them order a more accurate amount of materials needed and plan out the order to build things in.



### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_



It seemed like the easiest thing to think of...



### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._



Design and creation of buildings?



### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 

like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 



A "program" would be the finished blueprint, so to interact with the language would be to draw the building on grid paper with specifications of length and type of materials. 



### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the

user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to

the user?_



When a program "runs," people execute the building plans, put together the pieces specified in the blueprint, and voila, a building is made. Some errors would be buying the wrong materal, or having the wrong size for any piece. The construction workers would figure this out while trying to use the material/piece. More abstractly, there may be an error in physics calculations, and the building would topple.



### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but

difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_



It should be easy to design a building. It's technically possible to make blueprints of nearly anything, but this depends on how lenient the definition of "building" is and where the line between "building blueprints" and "general-purpose blueprints" are.

It should be impossible to do... anything outside of designing/planning the creation of physical objects.



### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there

aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 

do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the

language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_



Considering how open "building blueprints" could be taken, most likely not. Verbal planning may be considered a DSL, or a textual representation of a plan, though images work the best.



## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.



It doesn't, at least not for pencil-and-paper blueprints.

There are many ways to create an application for a building blueprint and then create a 3D model of it, but this has been done many times.



### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be

spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,

making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the

project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot

of language design)?_



That depends on what is implemented. The interpretation of the program isn't being done by a computer, so how much control would someone have over this?



### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_



Too ambitious, but thankfully, it's already been done.



### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 

project?_



It absolutely wouldn't be a good project. There's no need to reinvent the wheel.
